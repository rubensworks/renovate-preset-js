# Renovate Presets

This is a repository for reusable configs for the [Renovate](https://renovate.whitesourcesoftware.com/) automated dependency updater bot.

## JavaScript Preset

Makes sure that major updates always go via a PR, and other changes will be auto-merged if tests pass. Dependencies will be checked every morning.

To use this, create `renovate.json` in your repo with the following contents:
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "github>rubensworks/renovate-presets:js" 
  ]
}
```
